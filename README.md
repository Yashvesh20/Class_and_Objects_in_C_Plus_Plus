# Theory:
In Object Oriented Programming, classes and objects are basic concepts of that are used to represent real-world concepts and entities.
+ A class is a template to create objects having similar properties and behavior, or in other words, we can say that a class is a blueprint for objects.
An object is an instance of a class.

+ A class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions that can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.
Member Functions: Functions declared inside a class. Also referred to as a member method.

When a class is defined, only the specification (attributes and behaviour) for the object is defined. No memory is allocated to the class definition. 
Classes are generally declared in global scope and are accessible to every function or other classes once they are defined. But C++ also provides facility to define a class within a function. 
In C++, there are three access specifiers:
+ public - members are accessible from outside the class
+ private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class
+ protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.

# Implementaion:
The Concept of Classes and Objects is demonstrated using the following codes,
+ Displaying Student Information using classes
+ Displaying Car information using Classes and Methods
+ Calculators using Classes
+ Calculating the area of rectangle using Classes and Methods
+ Calculatiing the volume of a cuboid using Classes and Methods along with usage of private and public members.
